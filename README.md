A minimalist car navigation app designed specifically for **night-time driving** by projecting a **mirrored navigation interface** onto the windshield.

## What is it?

**NavHud** is a simple Android application built for drivers who want a distraction-free navigation experience at night. It works by:

- Displaying a clean, minimal map interface for route guidance.
- Mirroring the screen when tapped, so it reflects correctly onto your car's windshield ‚Äî creating a HUD (Head-Up Display), by putting the phone in a stable place, on the car's dashboard.
- Allowing you to choose destinations either by:
  - Long-pressing anywhere on the map
  - Using the search bar, that uses Google Places API.

## Usage
| Main Screen | Navigation Screen | Mirrored Navigation |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| The first screen is a map with a top search bar to search for destination places, or long tapping anywhere on the map to set a marker to navigate to | The navigation screen is a minimal map with the route to follow, no directions nor other distractions | You can flip the whole navigation screen by tapping anywhere, so you can mirror it to the windshield for easy readability at night |
